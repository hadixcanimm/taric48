Taric48 is a 2048 game you can play inside the League of Legends client. It’s made to kill time while waiting in queue.

Note: I used a Taric theme, but don’t ask why it’s Taric.

Features:

Taric Theme: Instead of numbers, there are Taric’s skins (you can switch back to numbers if you want).

Portable: You can drag the window anywhere you like within the client.

Resizable: You can play in small, medium, or large size.

Easy Access: Opens instantly with the question button  in the top right
